<!-- Good evening Professor,
 The link to my home page is https://robel921.github.io/MochaFunction/.
 to finish the homework it took me 2 hours. While doing this homework I had the chance to practice on mocha and how it tests the functions.
 after testing by mocha I found some errors and fixed them after that and got a correct output. testing was useful.-->
